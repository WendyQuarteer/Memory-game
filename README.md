## The Mission
We want to recreate the game memory. It is a game where you have a bunch of cards. Each card contains an image. Of each image there are exactly two cards. The cards are placed in a random order. You get to turn them around. If you turned around two cards they either turn back so you can't see their image if they did not match. And if they did match they stay image face visible.

### Must-have features

- []Clicking cards turns them around
- []Randomly position the cards
- [x]Readme, but that shouldn't even have to be said
- [x]Explanation on the page itself
- []Nice-to-have features
- []Make it playable by keyboard
- []Let a user define custom image urls
- []Make it pleasing to look at
- []Multiplayer (local)

- [x] HTML: add title

- [x] HTML: Have 4 square images (table)
- [x] CSS: make body display as a flex-box
- [x] CSS: make main margin auto to center the page & min-height = 100vh (size of the screen)
  (vh= 100% of the available height.)
- [x] JS: prepare variables for the cards, so we can use them
- [x] JS: make a string of the cards
- [x] JS: make a function for the computer to shuffle the cards
- [] JS: make a function for the cards, so it turns when clicked, and turns back when 2 different ones are turned.

- []Make their order random using javascript
- []Turn them back around if you clicked two
- []Then implement the logic to only turn back if they don't match
